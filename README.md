This is the eighth project of Javascript curriculum through The Odin Project, a Hash Map with the listed functions:

-hash(key) takes a key and produces a hash code with it.

-set(key, value) takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. It also handles the growth of the Hash Map.

-get(key) takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.

-has(key) takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.

-remove(key) takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If not it should return false.

-length() returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.

-clear() removes all entries in the hash map.

-keys() returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.

-values() returns an array containing all the values.

-entries() returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]].
